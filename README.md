# rKanColleLounge

rKanColleLounge is a visual novel featuring Admirals (random redditors) from [/r/KanColle](https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/)'s lounge. 

This all originates from a stupid idea [/u/Astraph had.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/7e2fu4/the_admirals_lounge/dq9qus1/)


### Premise

You've arrived at the Joint Anti-Abyssal Staff, trying to find your Admiral. You are a Kanmusu who went MIA during a sortie gone wrong, and now you're back as a completely normal girl. Travel along an adventure of love, hate, and everything in between.

### Featuring (soon)

Astraph - the pole leading the Joint Anti-Abyssal Staff's search efforts

Daisho - a mentally questionable admiral on the hunt for Shinano

SatanicAxe - "inb4 I get portrayed as the comic relief TTK frothing at the mouth over losing a high-tier shipgirl every time I show up."

Wororg - a german with a quest for more coffee

Kazul - american r&d guy

Velikiy_Knyaz - angry russian bicycle man

AverageTomato - a finn zuizui'ing zuizui's zuizuis

StoneFlame - communications guy in love with Isonami

EatMortredCrits, ruiooshima, DuskOfDawn23 & Secretary_Ooyodo - the administrators of the Joint Anti-Abyssal Staff 

ZeonTwoSix - japanese guy searching for musashi

Scoots - us army guy that manages communications and tech stuff

AdmiralSun - busy japanese man waiting for Tirpitz 

(if I miss anyone important that should probably be in here, just edit this file and add more to this I guess)
